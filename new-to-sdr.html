<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A software-defined radio is a radio implemented with reconfigurable software,
which processes the raw samples of a digitized radio signal.  This differs from
conventional hardware radios, which employ RF circuits and digital signal
processors to implement this processing in a way that is hardwired and
hardcoded to their application.</p>

<p>Software-defined radios offer the allure of instant reconfigurability in every
dimension: frequency, modulation, and protocol. In theory, you would simply run
a different program to implement an entirely different radio — whether it’s a
FM broadcast receiver, a UMTS handset, or a Bluetooth device. While there are
still real-world limitations to this dream, particularly in antennas and in
host processing power, software-defined radio today is a powerful technology
for building flexible communication systems, exploring the radio frequency
spectrum, and for protocol research and development.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>

<p>A software-defined radio still requires some hardware, but this hardware is
relegated to just receiving and transmitting radio signals. In total, a
software-defined radio system consists of an antenna, a transmitter and/or
receiver, and a host computer.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/figure-sdr-receiver.png" />
</p>

<p>When receiving, the antenna converts electromagnetic waves into a voltage
signal, which is then amplified, translated down from the tuning frequency, and
sampled by an SDR receiver. The digital samples are streamed to the host for
processing.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/figure-sdr-transmitter.png" />
</p>

<p>When transmitting, the host streams digital samples to an SDR transmitter,
which converts them into a voltage signal and translates it to the tuning
frequency. The voltage signal may then be further amplified by an external
amplifier and filtered by a transmit filter, before it is radiated by the
antenna as electromagnetic waves.</p>

<p>Conventional hardware radios today increasingly resemble software-defined
radios internally, as more of their processing is pushed into the digital
domain, and more complex protocols demand integrated CPUs.  However, they are
still tightly integrated black boxes that are designed to operate on a specific
frequency band, whereas software-defined radios provide a raw sample interface
and tend to have a wide tuning range.</p>

<h3 id="current-state">Current State</h3>

<p>Software-defined radio has become increasingly accessible over the past years
with the commoditization of high performance CPUs, and the availability of low
cost, high rate analog to digital converters (ADCs) and digital to analog
converters (DACs) that are responsible for sampling and synthesizing the radio
signal. The inexpensive $20 RTL-SDR dongle — described in more detail below —
has also played a role in exposing the technology to many engineers and
hobbyists.</p>

<p>However, the software of software-defined radio has yet to catch up to the
hardware. Much of it is scattered across esoteric one-off decoding programs,
trapped in frameworks bloated with boilerplate and dependencies, or confined to
proprietary Windows software. There has been little consolidation of common
code by the way of libraries, and even less effort on good documentation.
Fortunately, the tide seems to be turning. Lightweight signal processing
libraries are gaining traction, modern open source SDR applications are
cropping up, and the developer communities surrounding SDR are growing.</p>

<p>The rest of this guide covers the details of getting started with SDR
receivers, including hardware, software, a tour of the frequency bands, next
steps, and additional resources. Most of this introduction focuses on SDR
receivers, but SDR transmitters are touched on briefly in the next steps
section.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<h3 id="basic-specifications">Basic Specifications</h3>

<p>A software-defined radio receiver is defined by three basic specifications:
bandwidth, resolution, and tuning range. The receiver is further characterized
by many important figures of merit that reflect performance in noise,
selectivity, and frequency stability, but these specifications are deferred to
more advanced discussions.</p>

<p>Bandwidth is the instantaneous width of frequency content that the SDR receiver
can receive. It can be thought of as the width of the SDR’s window into the RF
spectrum.  This is usually in the range of 1 to 10 MHz for entry-level SDR
receivers, and in the 20 to 60 MHz range for the more advanced SDR
transceivers.  Bandwidth is different from tuning frequency; rather, more
bandwidth means that the SDR receiver can capture a wider window of signals
simultaneously when tuned to a particular frequency. In some cases, more
bandwidth is required to capture a very wide signal, like a 6 MHz wide
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a> channel.</p>

<p>The sample rate of an SDR receiver is the rate the radio signal is sampled by
the receiver and streamed to the host. Sample rate is directly related to the
bandwidth, and while bandwidth is ultimately the specification of interest,
SDRs are typically described by their sample rate, as it is the underlying
design parameter. An SDR’s effective bandwidth is usually slightly less than
its sample rate. Sample rate also dictates the computational burden on the
host: the wider the receive bandwidth, the more samples per second are required
to represent it, and consequently, the more bus throughput is required to
stream it to the host, and the more host computational power is required to
process it.</p>

<p>Resolution is the bit resolution of the analog to digital converter that
samples the radio signal. This represents the quantization range of each
sample. For example, an 8-bit ADC will have 256 levels of quantization,
whereas as 12-bit ADC will have 4096 levels. All things equal, more bit
resolution means less quantization noise — the “noise” resulting from the error
in mapping an analog level onto a discrete level, and more dynamic range — the
ability to capture both strong and weak signals simultaneously. In practice,
the usable resolution is highly dependent on the signal conditioning by the
frontend RF circuitry.</p>

<p>Tuning range is the frequency range that the SDR receiver can tune to. This
range typically starts in the tens of megahertz and goes up to a few gigahertz.
However, SDR receivers can receive signals outside of this range with the help
of an RF upconverter or downconverter, an inline device that translates signals
by a fixed frequency offset, so that they fall into the tuning range of the SDR.
For example, an SDR receiver with a tuning range of 24 MHz to 1766 MHz can be
paired with a 125 MHz RF upconverter, so that it can pick up 0 to 30 MHz at the
offset frequencies of 125 to 155 MHz.</p>

<p>While bandwidth, resolution, and tuning range are the basic specifications of
an SDR receiver, other figures of merit and design considerations can
dramatically affect an SDR receiver’s fidelity and usability.</p>

<h3 id="rtl-sdr-dongle">RTL-SDR dongle</h3>

<p>An inexpensive way to get started with SDR is the RTL-SDR dongle. The original
incarnation of this dongle and its chipset was marketed as a digital television
and audio broadcast receiver, particularly for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_broadcasting">DAB/DAB+</a> protocols,
which are used in parts of Europe and Asia. Eventually, <a href="https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki/Rtl-sdr#history_and_discovery_of_rtlsdr">a few developers
discovered</a>
that the demodulating and decoding for the DAB+ and FM receiver modes of this
device was actually implemented in the closed-source software itself, and in
those modes, the underlying <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/productsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PFid=35&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;ProdID=257">Realtek
RTL2832U</a>
chip streamed raw samples over USB. In other words, the dongle was a
software-defined radio receiver in those modes.</p>

<p>Since the RTL2832U enjoys the economy of scale of mass-produced consumer
silicon, it makes it possible to build an inexpensive SDR receiver hardware
stack based on the chip for sampling, and an accompanying tuner chip for the RF
frontend and tuning. Soon, third-parties started manufacturing dongles based on
the RTL2832U with improved tuners, noise performance, frequency stability, and
more convenient RF connectors, marketed specifically for software-defined radio
use.</p>

<p>RTL-SDR dongles can deliver a bandwidth of up to approximately 2.5 MHz
reliably, have 8-bit resolution, and a tuning range of 24 MHz to 1766 MHz (with
the currently popular R820T2 tuner). However, not all RTL-SDR dongles are made
equal. The generic ones found for under $10 on eBay may have inferior noise
performance and frequency stability.</p>

<p>Two popular dongles that have been vetted by the community are the <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/">RTL-SDR
Blog silver</a> and the
<a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr/nesdr-smart-sdr.html">NooElec NESDR SMArt
v4</a>.
Both run about $20 ($30 for bundle), and you can’t go wrong with either one.
See this <a href="http://rtlsdr4everyone.blogspot.com/p/review.html">review</a> for more
detailed testing on a variety of dongles, including these two.</p>

<h2 id="antennas">Antennas</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most “software-undefined” component of software-defined radio is
the antenna. It is also one of most important. Good reception on a particular
frequency band primarily depends on the antenna configuration. Antennas vary
in design frequency, bandwidth, directionality, and polarization, and different
applications demand different requirements in these properties.</p>

<p>An antenna’s physical size is typically proportional to the wavelengths it is
designed to receive. For example, antennas designed for reception at 15 MHz
tend to be much larger than those designed for 100 MHz, and especially larger
than a WiFi antenna designed for 2.4 GHz.</p>

<figure class="float-right">
<div align="center">

</figure>

<p>For example, the small stock monopole antenna that comes with some RTL-SDR
dongles (often the generic ones) is limited in performance and frequency
response to higher UHF frequencies. Users may be disappointed when they are not
able to pick up much aside from some UHF signals and very strong FM stations.
But this is entirely to be expected for an antenna of its design and size,
especially when used indoors and at a low elevation.</p>

<p>Wideband antennas, or antennas that can receive a broad range of frequencies,
are popular with SDRs, as they can accommodate the wide tuning range of the
SDR.  For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discone_antenna">discone</a>
is a common wideband antenna design. However, to get the most performance out
of any dedicated antenna, it should be placed outdoors and at high elevation.</p>

<figure class="float-right">

<p>For getting started with SDR, without initially investing too much time, money,
or real estate for an antenna, the RTL-SDR Blog’s <a href="https://amzn.to/1SLPS6F">RTL-SDR dongle and antenna
package</a> is probably the all-around best entry level
kit. The included long telescopic antenna performs decently for VHF signals,
even when used indoors, and the shorter telescopic antenna covers much of the
UHF band, so these two antennas can adjusted to most of the operating range of
the RTL-SDR. All of the VHF LuaRadio examples (WBFM, NBFM, AX.25, POCSAG, RDS)
can be run with the long 1m telescopic antenna indoors.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>Some of the earliest SDR software has its origins in the late 90s, with dial-up
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmodem">software modems</a> (e.g. the U.S.
Robotics “WinModem”) that implemented the majority of the modem in software,
allowing for more inexpensive hardware. Other early SDR software was software
support for amateur radio digital modes (FSK, PSK31, PACTOR, AX.25, etc.) that
were modulated in the audio band.  Amateur radio operators could interface the
audio of their radio transceivers to their PC’s sound card, and use software to
receive or transmit these digital modes.</p>

<p>Sound card operated digital modes are still popular in the amateur radio
community today, and there is an abundance of older decoding software from this
era in use or under maintenance. Some of this software has been retrofitted to
support modern I/Q sampling SDR receivers like the RTL-SDR.</p>

<p>Today, SDR software seems to broadly fall under five categories: waterfall
receivers, standalone decoders, frameworks, libraries, and web interfaces.
Below is a Linux-biased sampling of active SDR software projects.</p>

<h3 id="waterfall-receivers">Waterfall Receivers</h3>

<p>Waterfall receivers are characterized by a real-time vertical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a>, showing the frequency
spectrum of the SDR receiver’s passband over time.  Waterfall receivers also
simulate many functions of a wideband hardware RF receiver, like tuning,
demodulation modes, filters, and listening to demodulated audio.  Waterfall
receivers are useful for exploring the RF spectrum and selectively demodulating
parts of it.</p>

frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="radio-bands">Radio Bands</h2>

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/figure-itu-bands.png" />
</p>

<p>The radio spectrum is split up contiguously into named regions called bands.
Each band refers to a range of frequencies. Several international standards
have demarcated and named the radio spectrum bands, but in this introduction
we’ll stick to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum#ITU">ITU
designations</a>, e.g. HF, VHF,
UHF, etc.</p>

<p>Radio spectrum bands are not a pure commodity; a slice of the HF band is not
equivalent to a slice of the VHF band. This is because electromagnetic waves of
different radio frequencies have different interactions with the atmosphere and
earth, and this affects their propagation. Propagation on certain bands may be
sensitive to time of day, space weather, and solar weather. Propagation on
other radio bands may depend mostly on line of sight, and may only be sensitive
to terrestrial weather. The atmosphere may also present more or less opacity
for different frequencies to outer space, depending on the radio band.  In
effect, the various radio bands offer varying locality, which enables different
kinds of communication.</p>

<p>The bandwidth for each ITU band is not divided equally, but rather
logarithmically. Each subsequent band has approximately ten times the bandwidth
of the previous. This turns out to be a useful assignment, because the
frequencies within many of these bands have roughly similar propagation
characteristics. However, this also means that each frequency band —
characterized by a mode of propagation — offers different amounts of spectrum
compared to other frequency bands.</p>

<p>For example, 802.11b WiFi operates around 2.4 GHz in the UHF band (300 MHz to 3
GHz).  A single 802.11b WiFi channel is 22 MHz wide, which amounts to only 0.8%
of the UHF band, but on the HF band (3 to 30 MHz), that single channel would
require more than 80% of the entire band — not to mention the propagation
related reasons that this would be a bad idea.</p>

<p>The amount of spectrum available in a band dictates the bandwidth of signals
you can fit in the band, especially if the band is shared among multiple users.
For digital signals, this also dictates the maximum achievable data rate (see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_capacity">channel capacity</a>). This is
one reason that high data rate wireless technologies today occupy spectrum in
bands up in the gigahertz.</p>

<p>Below is a tour of the more common ITU frequency bands, including their primary
mode of propagation and what kind of signals can be found on them. These
descriptions are by no means complete; spectrum allocation is complicated and
region dependent.</p>

</div>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_frequency">low frequency band</a> (LF)
spans from 30 kHz to 300 kHz. Signals on LF primary propagate by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_wave#Ground_wave">ground
wave</a> propagation.</p>

<p>Due to limited spectrum in this band, LF is home mainly to low data rate
digital signals. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_clock#Longwave_and_shortwave_transmissions">time
stations</a>
which “atomic” clocks synchronize their time to (like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVB">WWVB</a> at 60 kHz), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon">non-directional
beacons</a> used for
navigation. In the past, the upper half of the band carried ~9 kHz wide
amplitude modulated audio broadcasting in some regions, and a few stations are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longwave#List_of_long-wave_broadcasting_transmitters">still
operating</a>,
but this has largely been phased out over the years and replaced with
broadcasting on MF or VHF.</p>

<p>There are also some region-dependent amateur radio allocations.</p>

<h3 id="mf">MF</h3>

<div align="center">

<figcaption>Snapshot of U.S. Spectrum Allocation for MF</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_frequency">medium frequency band</a>
(MF) spans from 300 kHz to 3000 kHz. Signals on MF propagate by both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_wave#Ground_wave">ground
wave</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave">skywave</a> propagation, but the lower
two-thirds of the band typically only propagate well by skywave at night.</p>

<p>The lower portion of the band, up to 500 kHz, is used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon">non-directional
beacons</a>, like in LF.</p>

<p>Nearly half of the band, from ~520 kHz to ~1600 kHz, is dedicated to ~9 kHz
wide amplitude modulated audio broadcasting, commonly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_radio">AM
radio</a>.</p>

<p>Above AM radio, there is an international amateur radio allocation from 1800
kHz to 2000 kHz, named the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/160-meter_band">160 meter
band</a>. This band is the start of
amateur radio privileges in many countries. Amateur radio is discussed in more
detail in the Amateur Radio section under Next Steps.</p>

<p>Broadcasting begins again at 3000 kHz and up. However, the aforementioned 160
meter amateur radio band and this broadcasting band are colloquially lumped
into HF, in part because their propagation mode is inclined to skywave
propagation, and frequencies from 1600 kHz to 30 MHz were historically called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio">shortwave</a>. These allocations
will be covered in the next section.</p>

<p>Otherwise, MF carries assorted region-dependent emergency communications in
some of the open patches between 1600 kHz to 3000 kHz.</p>

<p>Since AM radio station signals in the MF band are capable of propagating by
skywave under the right conditions, there is a hobby called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MW_DX">medium wave
DXing</a> for the long distance reception
(“DXing”) of AM radio stations across state or nation boundaries.</p>

<h3 id="hf">HF</h3>

</div>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency">high frequency band</a> (HF)
spans from 3 MHz (3000 kHz) to 30 MHz. Signals on HF propagate primarily by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave">skywave</a> propagation, in which signals
skip between the Earth and the ionosphere, enabling them to travel
international and transoceanic distances. However, this propagation is
sensitive to space and solar weather conditions, as those phenomena affect the
ionosphere.</p>

<p>If the radio spectrum is an ocean, then the HF band is its coral reefs.
Crowded and full of diverse international life, the HF band — commonly called
shortwave — is a global meeting point on the radio spectrum. With radio, this
electromagnetic conduit and natural wonder forms an infrastructure that enables
worldwide communication.</p>

<p>Shortwave is well known for its international radio broadcasts, whose
allocations are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio#Frequency_allocations">scattered
throughout</a>
the HF band. Shortwave radio stations typically broadcast 10 kHz wide amplitude
modulated audio. Many stations are government-run, providing news, culture, and
propaganda to domestic and international audiences. These stations often
broadcast in several languages, and may use directional antennas to target
their transmissions towards particular regions, e.g. the Voice of America
Africa service. Some government-run stations are public service stations, like
the time stations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHU_(radio_station)">CHU</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWV_(radio_station)">WWV</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVH">WWVH</a>, which broadcast continuously with
voice announcements of the time, or digital marine weather and news stations,
which may use protocols like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioteletype">RTTY</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofax">Weatherfax</a> to carry text and images,
modulated in the audioband of ~3 kHz wide
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sideband_modulation">single-sideband</a>
modulated transmissions.</p>

<p>Although shortwave broadcasting is dominated by government-sponsored stations,
private shortwave broadcasting exists too. In the US, much of it is religious,
with a few stations that carry music and talk programs. For a complete schedule
of shortwave radio stations, check out <a href="https://short-wave.info/"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> https://short-wave.info</a>.</p>

<p>The HF band is home to many international <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_frequency_allocations#High_frequency">amateur radio
allocations</a>,
where amateurs can carry out morse, voice, or digital communication with one
another. Voice modes are usually ~3 kHz wide single-sideband modulated audio.
Digital modes are typically modulated in the audioband within these
single-sideband audio transmissions. Morse code uses a modulation method called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave">continuous wave</a>, which is
essentially an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-off_keying">on-off keyed</a>
carrier. HF amateur radio operators often participate in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contesting">contests</a> to make the most contacts
in a limited period of time.</p>

<p>The military has a presence on HF as well, often for air force and navy related
communications. Some governments have run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station">numbers
stations</a> at some point in time
to deliver instructions to the military or agents operating on foreign soil.
Several numbers stations continue to operate to this day. Many number stations
use ordinary amplitude modulated broadcasts that can be received by any
shortwave radio.</p>

<p>HF is also used as backup commercial aviation and maritime communication.
Aircraft on trans-oceanic flights are required to be equipped with an HF
transceiver. The international maritime distress and calling frequency is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2182_kHz">2182
kHz</a>.</p>

<p>A notable allocation towards the upper end of the HF band at 27 MHz is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio">Citizen
Band radio</a>.  This
allocation provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_radio_service">personal radio
service</a>, allowing local
unlicensed communication for individuals. CB radio uses ~10 kHz wide narrowband
frequency modulated audio, rather than the amplitude modulation that is common
throughout the HF band. Despite its upstanding name, CB radio has a reputation
for offensive trucker banter.</p>

<p>While shortwave broadcasting as a medium for news and culture has largely been
superseded by the internet, it still continues to serve rural communities, and
is slowly undergoing a modernization push towards digital, with protocols like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Radio_Mondiale">Digital Radio Mondiale</a>,
or Voice of America’s pilot <a href="https://voaradiogram.net/">Radiogram</a> project,
which carries news text and images over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_MFSK">Olivia
MFSK</a>.</p>

<p>It’s important to point out that while the internet is decentralized in
protocol and spirit, its infrastructure is inherently centralized physically,
built with fiber optic, coaxial, and twisted pair cables, and the occasional
satellite link. The HF band, although drastically limited in bandwidth compared
to the internet, is nature’s “fiber optic cable” that will continue to carry
transmissions worldwide from a lantern battery <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRP_operation">or
less</a>, even when all of the grid
lights are out. In this sense, HF is a curiosity as a truly decentralized
communication medium, in both the network and physical layers.</p>

<h3 id="vhf">VHF</h3>

</div>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency">very high frequency
band</a> (VHF) spans from 30
MHz to 300 MHz. Signals on VHF propagate primarily by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line of sight
propagation</a>, similar
to light. However, VHF radio waves experience a slightly farther horizon than
visible light, called the radio horizon, due to refraction in the atmosphere
for these frequencies. VHF radio waves can penetrate non-metallic objects like
drywalls, although with attenuation, and can reflect off of large metallic
objects like buildings.</p>

<p>Approximately a quarter of the VHF band is dedicated to audio and television
broadcasting. The common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting">FM
radio</a> broadcasting sits at ~87
to ~108 MHz, carrying ~200 kHz wide frequency modulated audio.  Television
broadcasting allocations vary from region to region, but typically are
comprised of two contiguous bands in the 40 MHz to 80 MHz range, and one large
band in the 170 to 216 MHz range. Most television broadcasting has switched to
digital, using the ~5 to 8 MHz wide
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a> protocol in much of the world, or
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_terrestrial_television">ASTC</a>
protocol in North America. Some regions have reallocated 174 to 230 MHz from
television to digital audio broadcasting, with the ~1500 kHz wide
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_broadcasting">DAB</a> protocol, in an
effort to eventually upgrade from analog FM radio.</p>

<p>VHF has aviation and marine navigation and emergency communication allocations.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range">VHF Omnidirectional
Range</a> (VOR)
navigation beacons sit directly above FM radio broadcasting, at 108 to 118 MHz.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airband">airband</a> spans from 118 to 137 MHz
for air traffic control communication, and uses ~10 kHz wide amplitude
modulation audio (in contrast to most frequency modulated audio signals on
VHF). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_VHF_radio">Marine VHF</a> uses ~16 kHz
wide frequency modulated audio in the 156 to 162 MHz range. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System">Automatic
Identification
System</a> (AIS) is
a position reporting system used by ships, located at the end of the Marine VHF
band. AIS uses a ~10 kHz wide digital
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-shift_keying#Gaussian_minimum-shift_keying">GMSK</a>
modulation.</p>

<p>Amateur radio typically has two main allocations on VHF, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-meter_band">6 meter
band</a> from 50 to 54 MHz and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-meter_band">2
meter band</a> from 144 to 148 MHz.
The 6 meter is a somewhat experimental band, exhibiting long distance skywave
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_E_propagation">sporadic E</a>
propagation under certain seasonal and meteorological conditions. The 2 meter
band is a very popular amateur radio band for voice communications, often
supported by local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater">repeaters</a> that
receive and rebroadcast transmissions from a high elevation for extended
reception, and used for amateur satellite
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-meter_band#Satellite_communications">uplink</a>.
Amateur radio operation on VHF is typically ~10 kHz wide frequency modulated
audio, carrying voice or a digital protocol like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AX.25">AX.25</a> for packet radio, but can also be
~3 kHz wide single-sideband modulated audio, or even continuous wave for morse.</p>

<p>The VHF band has numerous allocations for licensed business and public service
two-way radio communication. Many of these still use analog frequency modulated
audio, but some carry digital protocols like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio">DMR</a> and may even be
multiplexed with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunked_radio_system">trunked radio
system</a>.</p>

<p>In the US, unlicensed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_radio_service">personal radio
service</a> is also provided
by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Use_Radio_Service">MURS</a> allocation
from ~151 to ~154 MHz.</p>

<h3 id="uhf">UHF</h3>

</div>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency">ultra high frequency
band</a> (UHF) spans from 300 MHz
to 3 GHz. Signals on UHF propagate primarily by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line of sight
propagation</a>, like in VHF.</p>

<p>UHF is by far the most diverse band with respect to devices and digital
modulations. Its short wavelengths allow for efficient, compact antennas, which
can be easily integrated into portable electronics and small appliances, like
mobile phones or WiFi routers. UHF is the primary spectral medium for cellular
and wireless technologies today.</p>

<p>Like VHF, UHF has some allocations for audio and television broadcasting.
Television broadcasting spans from approximately 470 to 800 MHz, using the
digital ~5 to 8 MHz wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a> protocol
in much of the world, or the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSC_standards">ASTC</a> protocol in North America.
Audio broadcasting is also available in some regions in the 1452 to 1492 MHz
band, with the ~1500 kHz wide digital
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_broadcasting">DAB</a> protocol.
DAB/DAB+ is the leading standard in replacing analog FM broadcast radio in most
of the world.</p>

<p>Approximately 20% of the UHF band is allocated for cellular technologies.  The
allocations vary by region, and depending on the carrier that owns the band,
may carry different protocols, e.g. GSM (2G), UMTS (3G), or LTE (4G).
Allocations tend to exist near 800 to 900 MHz and near 1700 to 2200 MHz bands.
See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_frequencies">cellular
frequencies</a> page on
Wikipedia for more information.</p>

<p>An important set of international allocations are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band">Industrial, Scientific
and Medical</a> (ISM) bands. Despite their
catch-all name, the vast majority of low power local wireless technologies,
from garage door openers and weather sensors, to WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and
NFC, all use these bands. The ISM bands were originally intended to isolate
noisy electromagnetic devices, like microwaves at 2.45 GHz or some medical
devices, from clean spectrum reserved for communications. In effect, the ISM
bands were unlicensed wild west zones in the spectrum and any devices designed
for it needed to be robust to incidental interference. Over time, low power
local wireless technologies have proliferated on these bands.</p>

<p>The UHF band has two major ISM allocations. The lower frequency one ranges from
~433 to ~435 MHz in ITU region 1 (e.g. Europe, Africa, Middle East), or from
902 to 928 MHz in ITU region 2 (e.g. Americas, Greenland). These bands are
often called 433 MHz or 915 MHz, respectively, and are frequently used for low
data rate signaling devices, like key fobs or home alarm systems. These devices
typically use a simple digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude-shift_keying">amplitude shift
keying</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying">frequency
shift keying</a> modulation.
The higher frequency ISM allocation is from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz, which spans 100 MHz
and is available worldwide. This allocation is frequently used by high data
rate systems, like WiFi or Bluetooth, with more sophisticated digital
modulations like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying">8PSK</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing">OFDM</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum">direct-sequence spread
spectrum</a>.</p>

<p>Amateur radio has several allocations on the UHF band, the most common of which
is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70-centimeter_band">70 centimeter band</a>
from ~420 to ~450 MHz.  Like the 2 meter band on VHF, the 70 centimeter band is
also commonly used for voice communications, supported by local
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater">repeaters</a> that receive and
rebroadcast transmissions from a high elevation for extended reception, and
used for amateur satellite uplink. The UHF band also includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23-centimeter_band">23
centimeter band</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13-centimeter_band">13
centimeter band</a> allocations
for amateur radio, which might be used for experimental purposes or for amateur
radio satellite uplinks. Amateur radio operation on UHF is typically ~10 kHz
wide frequency modulated audio, but can also be ~3 kHz wide single-sideband
modulated audio, or even continuous wave for morse.</p>

<p>The UHF band has several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_radio_service">personal radio
service</a> allocations for
unlicensed two-way communications by individuals and businesses. For example,
certain regions have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_CB">UHF Citizen Band</a>
allocation from ~476 to ~478 MHz, similar to the HF Citizen Band. Much of the
EU has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMR446">PMR446</a> allocation from
~446.0 to ~446.2 MHz, with channels set aside for analog ~10 kHz wide frequency
modulated audio, as well as the digital ~6.25 kHz wide
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_private_mobile_radio">dPMR446</a> and ~12.5
kHz wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio#DMR_Tier_I">DMR</a>
protocols.  The US and some other countries in the Americas, have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Radio_Service">Family
Radio Service</a> (FRS) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Mobile_Radio_Service">General Mobile Radio
Service</a> (GMRS) in
the ~462 to ~467 MHz range. GMRS requires a license to operate in the United
States. FRS and GMRS use analog ~10 kHz wide frequency modulated audio.</p>

<p>Aircraft use a position reporting system called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast">ADS-B</a>
which is centered at 1090 MHz (for “Mode-S” transmissions) in the UHF band. The
1090 MHz Mode-S transmissions use a 50 kHz wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-position_modulation">pulse position
modulation</a>.</p>

<p>Other notable allocations in the UHF band include those for satellite
communications.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS">GLONASS</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation)">Galileo</a> all use
allocations inside of the 1 to 2 GHz range for their downlink, at carrier
frequencies around 1.2, 1.3, and 1.6 GHz. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_Communications">Iridium</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inmarsat">Inmarsat</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalstar">Globalstar</a> satellite
telecommunication services operate uplink and downlink in several bands
allocated across the 1.5 to 1.7 GHz range. Satellite radio services, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM_Holdings">SiriusXM</a>, have a 2310 to
2360 MHz allocation for downlink in North America. These systems all use
digital modulations and custom protocols.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_high_frequency">super high frequency
band</a> (SHF) spans from 3
GHz to 30 GHz. Signals on SHF propagate by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line of sight
propagation</a>, like in
UHF and VHF, but due to their small wavelengths, SHF radio waves may also be
focused by reasonably sized highly directional antennas, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_antenna">parabolic
antennas</a>.</p>

<p>SHF has two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band">Industrial, Scientific, and Medical
band</a> allocations from 5.725 to 5.875
GHz and 24 to 24.25 GHz. The 5.8 GHz is commonly known for its use in the Wi-Fi
802.11a, 802.11n, and 802.11ac protocols. These protocols either use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing">OFDM</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO-OFDM">MIMO-OFDM</a> digital modulations.</p>

<p>Amateur radio has several allocations on the SHF band, including the 9, 5, 3,
and 1.2 centimeter bands. These bands are well suited for amateur radio
satellite communication, as well as experimental point-to-point communications.</p>

<p>Due to the achievable high directivity and large spectral bandwidth available,
SHF is commonly used in point-to-point links for terrestrial and space
communications. For terrestrial communications, these are often used in
telecommunications backhaul, linking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_transceiver_station">base
stations</a> to their
network. For satellite communications, the SHF band subsumes the more common
IEEE band names <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_band">C</a>,

</div>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency">extremely high frequency
band</a> (EHF) spans from
30 GHz to 300 GHz. Signals on EHF propagate by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line of sight
propagation</a> as well,
but the higher frequencies have limited range due to atmospheric absorbance by
water and oxygen molecules. EHF signals are sensitive to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_fade">rain</a>.</p>

<p>The EHF band is used for high data rate, short terrestrial point-to-point
links, as well as some satellite communications up to about 50 GHz. The
atmosphere absorbs most EHF frequencies above this, rendering it unusable for
satellite communication — see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_window">radio
window</a>. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Gigabit_Alliance">802.11ad</a> protocol is
designed to operate around 60 GHz for local high data rate wireless
communication. Otherwise, much of the EHF band is undeveloped.</p>

<p>The high data rate, and consequently wide bandwidth, signals on SHF and EHF are
not easy to receive, process, or transmit with off-the-shelf SDR transceivers,
as their bandwidth is limited to up to about 60 MHz. In general, SDR technology
lags behind that of conventional hardware with respect to bandwidth, due to
limited efficiency of analog to digital conversion technology at very high
sample rates, and the computational burden very high sample rates impose.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation">tremendously high frequency

GHz to 3 THz. Signals on THF propagate by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency">line of sight
propagation</a>.
Technology to radiate and modulate THF radio waves is still in the research
phase, but this band will probably be limited in application to close range
high bandwidth point-to-point links (at least on Earth), like much of the EHF
band.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps…</h2>

<h3 id="amateur-radio">Amateur Radio</h3>

<p>A great way to further develop radio fundamentals is to become an amateur radio
operator. Amateur radio is the hobby of making radio contacts, experimenting
with radio hardware and antennas, and for some, providing backup communications
in case of an emergency that compromises local infrastructure.</p>

<p>Portions throughout the RF spectrum have been set aside by international
agreements expressly for amateur radio use. An amateur radio license grants the
privilege to transmit on these spectrum allocations, often with unrestricted
choice of modulation and protocol, and at high power (e.g. up to 1.5 kilowatts
on many bands in the United States).  Without an amateur radio license, legal
radio transmissions with unlicensed hardware are limited to relatively low
power on the crowded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band">ISM bands</a>. A map
of the US amateur radio allocations is available
<a href="http://www.arrl.org/graphical-frequency-allocations">here</a>.</p>

<p>The spectrum dedicated to amateur radio would be worth billions if it were sold
for private ownership, so it’s a delicate blessing that politics have favored
this culture in telecommunications history. As it stands today, transmitting
with a radio is not protected under a right like free speech, but is a licensed
privilege regulated by the government.</p>

<p>Operating amateur radio helps to develop an intuition for real world signals,
like the bandwidth of various analog and digital modulations, the propagation
of different radio frequency bands, and the logistics of operating a legal
transmitter. It also revisits some recurring themes in technology, like the
trade-offs between analog vs. digital systems, proprietary vs. open standards,
and centralized (VHF/UHF repeaters) vs. decentralized (HF) networks.</p>

<h4 id="getting-a-license">Getting a License</h4>

<p>In the United States, amateur radio licenses come in three levels: Technician
Class, General Class, and Amateur Extra Class. The Technician license grants
transmit privileges on all amateur radio bands above 30 MHz, whereas the higher
license levels grant transmit privileges on progressively more spectrum in the
lower frequency HF band. The Technician license can be obtained by scoring 75%
or better on a 35 question multiple choice exam, and costs about $15 to take.
These tests are not difficult to pass, as the question and answer pools for
each level are published in advance.</p>

<p>Studying for the amateur radio license is a great way to learn basic concepts
about modulations, propagation, antennas, and international spectrum laws. This
is the six-step plan I followed to getting a license and on the air in about
1.5 weeks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a local exam session with <a href="http://www.arrl.org/find-an-amateur-radio-license-exam-session">this
page</a></li>
  <li>Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Track-Technician-Class-Radio-License/dp/1720317992/">The Fast Track To Your Technician Class Ham Radio
License</a> book</li>
  <li>Practice flash cards on <a href="https://hamstudy.org/">HamStudy</a> or
<a href="https://hamexam.org/">HamExam</a></li>
  <li>Take and pass the exam</li>
  <li>Wait until your call sign appears in the <a href="https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchLicense.jsp">FCC
database</a></li>
  <li>Make your first contact on a local VHF or UHF repeater with a Baofeng
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-UV-5R-Dual-Radio-Black/dp/B007H4VT7A/">UV-5R</a></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="culture">Culture</h4>

<p>The amateur radio culture in the United States is a peculiar mix of radio
geeks, electronics tinkerers, and preppers. Some enjoy it simply for casual
conversation with like-minded radio enthusiasts on their commute to or from
work. Others are in it purely for the decentralized, self-sufficient means of
communications it enables, perhaps for survival preparedness or for
volunteering for emergency communications. And many hams tinker with antennas,
low power transceivers, installing repeaters, or even building dedicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_shack">ham
shacks</a>.</p>

<p>Hams were some of the original
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">“makers”</a> of their time, and
though on bad days may share their hand-wavy engineering, they also have a
history of publishing academic-esque articles on subjects like propagation,
circuits, and antenna design. Amateur radio is also increasingly intersecting
with the modern “hacker” culture, leading to more amateur radio related
presentations, hosted license exam sessions, or the establishment of a regular
<a href="https://conham.org/">contact frequency on VHF</a> at security conferences like
<a href="https://defcon.org/">DEF CON</a>.</p>

<p>The privileges granted by amateur radio also raises some interesting political
questions, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the FCC’s authority justified by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution?</li>
  <li>Should there be more diverse unlicensed “public parks” on the radio spectrum,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio">Citizens Band</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Radio_Service">Family Radio Service</a>,
but for audio broadcasting or for digital transmissions?</li>
  <li>How does radio contrast to other communication methods that are protected by
free speech?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="antennas-1">Antennas</h3>

<p>As far as antennas go, the sky is the limit. This is true in all respects:
design, price, size, and elevation. Optimized antennas exist for just about
every radio frequency band and application.</p>

<p>A great starting point for exploring SDR is a pair of wideband antennas: one
that covers the lower frequency LF, MF, and HF bands, and one that covers the
lower bulk of the higher frequency VHF and UHF bands. An easy way to achieve
this combination is with a long-wire antenna for the lower bands, and a discone
antenna for the higher bands.</p>

</figure>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_wire_antenna">long-wire antenna</a> is
what it sounds like — a long wire, strung up at high elevation. These antennas
are effective basic antennas for receiving and transmitting across the HF band.
They are better when paired with a <a href="https://vk6ysf.com/unun_9-1.htm">9:1 unun</a>
impedance transformer, to help match the relatively large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)#Impedance_matching">antenna
impedance</a> to
the lower 75 ohm impedance of the RTL-SDR, or to the 50 ohm impedance of most
other receivers and transmitters.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<figure class="float-right">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discone_antenna"><img src="./images/discone-antenna-thumb.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>Discone antenna<div style="line-height: 0.8;"><a style="font-size: 0.9rem;" href="https://www.hamradio.com/detail.cfm?pid=H0-007179">(Image Source)</a></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discone_antenna">discone antenna</a> is an
omnidirectional antenna that looks like a disc on a cone. It has approximately
10:1 bandwidth, relative to the center frequency. which makes it a good choice
for the VHF and UHF bands as a receiving antenna. A discone antenna with a
center frequency of 50, 75 or 100 MHz is reasonably sized, and can be
constructed with materials from your local hardware store.</p>

<p>For receiving and transmitting on the 2m and 70cm amateur radio bands on VHF or
UHF, an inexpensive option is the <a href="http://www.n9tax.com/slim%20jim%20info.html">roll-up
J-pole</a>, which can be bought
assembled for about $25.</p>

<p>Some applications require specific antennas for effective reception or
transmission, because of properties like long wave length, polarization, or
directionality.  For example, receiving a VLF time station benefits from a
resonant magnetic loop antenna, which is substantially smaller in size than its
equivalently performing dipole or monopole electric field antenna. Receiving
circularly polarized radio waves from satellites, e.g. a weather satellite,
benefit from a circularly polarized antenna, like a quadrifilar helix antenna.
Receiving the ISS, as it orbits the Earth at a certain elevation, is a lot
easier with a directional Yagi antenna.</p>

<p>Certain situations, like electrically noisy apartment buildings or the lack of
outdoor access, may also call for alternate antennas designs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_antenna">magnetic
loop antennas</a>, which can produce
better results indoors than an electric field antenna.</p>

<h3 id="rf-upconverter">RF Upconverter</h3>

<p>In order to receive the lower frequency LF, MF, and HF bands on the RTL-SDR,
they must be translated into the tuning range of the RTL-SDR. This can be done
with the help of an inline RF device called an upconverter, which translate a
range of frequencies up by a constant frequency offset. For example, a 125 MHz
upconverter designed for the lower frequency bands will translate signals from
0 to 30 MHz to 125 to 155 MHz.</p>

<p>Two popular upconverters that can be used with the RTL-SDR and other SDR
receivers for the LF, MF, and HF bands are the <a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-addons/ham-it-up-304/ham-it-up-plus.html">NooElec Ham It Up
Plus</a>
and the <a href="https://airspy.com/spyverter-r2/">Airspy SpyVerter R2</a>. They are
available for around $50 to $60 (with a shielded case).</p>

</div>

<p>An appropriate low frequency antenna (e.g. long-wire antenna) and one of these
upconverters enable an SDR receiver with a higher tuning range to receive the
lower frequency bands.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-1">Hardware</h3>

<p>There are several SDR receivers on the market with better performance and
higher sample rates than the RTL-SDR:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://airspy.com/airspy-mini/">Airspy Mini</a> — 3, 6, or 10 MSPS sample
rate, 24 to 1700 MHz tuning range, 12-bit ADC, $99 USD</li>
  <li><a href="https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/">Airspy HF+ Discovery</a> — up to 36
MSPS sample rate, 0.5 kHz to 31 MHz, 60 MHz to 260 MHz tuning range, 18-bit
ADC, $169 USD</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sdrplay.com/rsp1a/">SDRplay RSP1A</a> — 2 to 10.66 MSPS sample
rate, 1 kHZ to 2000 MHz tuning range, 14-bit ADC, $109 USD</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also many SDR transceivers on the market. Note that transmitting with
an SDR with the intent of high power radiation (i.e. not testing locally or
with a loopback) requires some additional external hardware, like an RF power
amplifier and a transmit bandpass filter. Transmissions should only be made on
authorized frequencies, and with a setup that ensures transmit harmonics are
thoroughly suppressed, so that they are not unintentionally radiated, otherwise
they may interfere with other transmissions.</p>

<p>A few examples of SDR transceivers are:</p>
